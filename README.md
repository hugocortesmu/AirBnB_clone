# AirBnB clone
### Higher-level programming
***
I know you were waiting for it: it’s here!

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
